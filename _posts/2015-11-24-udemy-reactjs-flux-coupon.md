Udemy has offered 50 free coupons for the readers of my blog, for the course ['Build Web Apps with React JS and Flux'](https://www.udemy.com/learn-and-understand-reactjs/). <br>

Coupon code: `thoughtstostring`

I've been trying to get my hands dirty with React and Flux, and hope to blog about my experience with the library sometime soon. Meanwhile, enjoy the course!
