   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;thoughts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;thoughts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having decided to blog, and contribute to some more garbage on the internet, I went looking out for a really quick way to set up shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My criteria:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reponsive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick set-up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hassle-free templating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sufficient control over layouting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick and easy publishing and hosting&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More focus on content, less on styling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write content like writing code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some obvious &amp;#39;go to&amp;#39; blog sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blogger.com/&quot;&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt;. But I wanted to keep away from those, as I knew they didn&amp;#39;t meet some of my criteria. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was curious about some of the new blogging platforms like &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghost.org/&quot;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://svbtle.com/&quot;&gt;Svtle&lt;/a&gt;, etc. They looked nice, simple and had a clear focus on content. Their USP, compared to the traditional blogging platforms, was content discovery. But somehow they looked more like magazine articles to me, than blogs - which can be good or bad, depending on one&amp;#39;s perspective. Anyway, I started comparing these new platforms to analyze the pros/cons, when I accidently bumped into a few blogers talking about moving their blogs to &amp;#39;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39; and why they did so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was aware of Github pages for projects, but never really thought of it as a blogging platform. A bit of googling got me introduced to &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and the built-in support in Github Pages. In a matter of minutes, most of my criteria was being checked off. And even before I realized, I was heads down into it. It felt a lot like coding. And in no time, I was ~~writing~~ marking down my first blog. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is essentially a parser + generator. It parses content (markdown/textile), liquifies it into templates and spits out a static website ready to be served - in my case, graciously, by Github. The added advantage for me were the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freedom to write content in my favorite text editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write content offline and publish anytime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preview my blog locally (offline) before publishing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish blogs with a mere git push&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple, version controlled, static site generator with markdown and templating was very close to what I had in my mind (subconciously) an hour ago when I stared looking for a blogging platform. Yes, all this happened in 60 minutes! For a change, I was happy about not being a victim of analysis-paralysis. :) (Note to self: Look for smiley suport with markdown renderers) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some more aspects like SEO, administration, plugin support, theming etc. that I haven&amp;#39;t analyzed as yet. But I&amp;#39;m already feeling positive about Github Pages + Jekyll combination. And since this has taken me only few minutes to go from zilch to live, I have no complaints!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days, I will be experimenting with this platform and, in the process blogging, about it. So I don&amp;#39;t have to break my head over topics to blog about - a win-win! (And a big relief! Phew!)&lt;/p&gt;
